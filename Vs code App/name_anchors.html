    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>Heavy metals are metallic elements with high atomic weight and density. These include the transition metals, some metalloids, lanthanides and actinides. Amounting to more than 20 metals generally exist in a positively charged form and can bind on to negatively-charged organic molecules. Being metals ions, heavy metal cannot be degraded or destroyed, therefore their stability make them as the persistent toxic substances in environment. Heavy metal as the environmental contaminants can be found in the air, soil and water, which pose health hazard to the general public. Presence of heavy metal in water as the contaminants is an indication of global industrialization attributed to large scale of inappropriate disposal and untreated of wastewater containing heavy metal from anthropogenic sources (United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, 2010). Water functions as a medium of transport for pollutants and they can be damaging to both living organisms and the environment (Harrison, 2001). Heavy metals can bio-accumulate over a period of time and the concentrations become apparent and measureable.</p> 
    <p>food chains and tropic levels, heavy metal bio-accumulation within target organ or tissue of organisms can ultimately threaten human health. Globally, regulatory organizations have implemented regulations through the maximum permissible limits for the discharge of heavy metal in the aquatic environment and intervention through ISO 14000 in order to control contamination. However, the heavy metal are being released at a higher concentration than the prescribed limits especially through anthropogenic point source, thus leading to the health hazards and water pollution.</p>
    <p>Cadmium is a heavy metal that is found in the earth’s crust. It is always found combined with other substances such as oxygen (cadmium oxide), sulphur (cadmium sulphate, or suphide) and chlorine (cadmium chloride). Cadmium is extracted as a by-product during the production of other metals such as zinc, lead and copper. Cadmium is used in many consumer products including batteries, jewellery, and metal coatings. It is also found in¬ foods including some shellfish, leafy vegetables, nuts and kidney meats. Drinking water materials used in both distribution and household plumbing can result in cadmium contamination. Cadmium can leach into water through galvanised water pipes. Galvanised pipes are steel pipes that have been dipped in a protective coating to protect against corrosion and rust. Levels of cadmium in water may be higher in areas supplied with soft water of low pH because this can be more corrosive in plumbing systems containing cadmium. Cadmium can also be present in drinking water due to its use in multiple industrial processes which lead to cadmium waste contaminating water supplies and cadmium dust in the air settling into water sources. Cadmium exposure can occur through ingestion (swallowing food that contains cadmium) and inhalation (breathing).Short term exposure to high cadmium levels can cause coughing, chest pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Whereas long term exposure can cause lung damage, kidney disease and convulsions. Exposure to lower levels of cadmium for a long time can cause fragile bones that break easily. The WHO has established a provisional guidelines value of 0.003mg/L for Cd in drinking water (WHO, 2017). The EPA has also set a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 0.005 mg/L for Cd in public water supplies (EPA, 2009).</p>
    <p>Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal and has been classified as potentially hazardous and toxic to most forms of life (Awofolu, 2005). Its widespread use has caused extensive environmental contamination, human exposure and health problems in many parts of the world. It is a cumulative toxicant that can affect multiple body systems. Children are particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxin effects of lead (WHO, 2016).Lead exposure causes a significant burden of disease: it is estimated that lead exposure accounts for 0.9 million deaths per year (IHME, 2020) and 30% of the global burden of developmental intellectual disability of unknown origin (WHO, 2019). The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified lead as one of 10 chemicals of major public health concern needing action by Member States. Lead as an additive in petrol was previously an important source of exposure, but from 2021 all countries have banned such use of lead (UNEP, 2021). However, other important potential sources of exposure to lead remain because of its widespread use, including in batteries, paint, aviation fuels, and ceramic glazes in food containers, as well as in pipes and fittings, and other components in contact with drinking-water. Further efforts are required to reduce the use and release of lead, and reduce environmental and occupational exposures, particularly for children and women of childbearing age (WHO, 2021). Given the public health significance of lead in drinking-water, WHO has assessed this contaminant regularly in the Guidelines for drinking-water quality, Since 1993, the guideline value for lead in the WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality has been 10 µg/L. In 2011, this health-based guideline value was changed to a provisional value to reflect treatment achievability, recognizing that it is difficult to achieve lower than 10 µg/L with central treatment. Lead can occur in drinking-water as a result of leaching or particulate release from lead-containing components or materials. The lead content of the water depends on the lead content of materials exposed to water, the duration of contact between the affected materials and the water, how and where in the supply system these materials are installed, and the overall water chemistry. For piped water supplies, lead-containing components can include service connection pipes (between the water mains and buildings), solder joints, and taps and fittings in household plumbing systems. In hand pump systems, lead contamination can come from lead-containing components in pumps or well parts. In some cases, lead is present in the water source itself, originating from the bedrock or pollution. Further, regardless of source, lead can accumulate as deposits on galvanized or cast iron components, which can then be released.</p>

    <h2>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</h2>	
    <p>In Nigeria, several incident of lead poisoning have been reported. An instance is the lead poisoning reported in Zamfara State, where more than 100 children in the villages of Dareta and Yargalma were seriously affected with a mean blood lead concentration of 119μg/dl (level as low as 10μg/dl are associated with impaired neurological development in young children). Moreover, lead concentration in soil of more than 100,000 ppm where found in and around the habitation in the villages (Galadima and Garba 2012).  More than half of Nigeria population receives its drinking water from ground water that is, through wells drilled into aquifer (Adeyeye and Abulude 2004).  	
    Numerous studies conducted around the world have detected concerning levels of cadmium and lead in drinking water supplies. A study by Khan et al. (2010) analyzed drinking water sources in Pakistan and found mean cadmium levels ranging from 1.2-2.3 μg/L, with several samples exceeding the WHO guideline of 3 μg/L. Lead levels were high across all sites, with an average of 28.7 μg/L. 
    In India, a survey of groundwater sources in Andhra Pradesh reported average cadmium levels of 0.26 μg/L, with a maximum of 1.12 μg/L (Subba Rao et al., 2012). Lead concentrations ranged from 1.2 - 161 μg/L, indicating a high frequency of guideline value exceedances. 
    A Canadian study tested municipal drinking water systems across several provinces and found that larger communities with older distribution infrastructure had higher lead levels (Morissette et al., 2015). Over 15% of samples from large cities exceeded the national guideline value of 5 μg/L for lead. Exposure to lead through drinking water was estimated to substantially increase blood lead levels in young children.</p>
    <p>In the US, a survey of public drinking water supplies by the Environmental Working Group detected cadmium in 7% of tested systems, although levels were generally very low (Olson, 2017). However, over 170 systems were found to have lead levels above the EPA action level of 15 ppb in 2011.
    In Europe, a review by Michalke et al. (2007) reported that cadmium levels in European drinking waters are generally low, with 95th percentile concentrations of 0.35 μg/L. However, some areas in Germany, the UK, Sweden and Finland have reported higher cadmium levels ranging from 0.5-5 μg/L. Lead levels were more variable across Europe, with 95th percentile concentrations ranging from 1-24 μg/L. The authors note that lead pipes and solders are still significant sources in many European drinking water systems.
    A large-scale study of residential tap water across the United States detected cadmium in 6.5% of samples, with a 90th percentile level of 0.50 μg/L (Toccalino et al., 2014). Lead was detected in about half of samples, with a 90th percentile concentration of 4.1 μg/L. Several variables including older housing, lower pH, and higher water hardness were associated with increased lead concentrations.</p> 
    <p>In Brazil, a survey of tap water in public schools found that 35% of samples contained concerning levels of lead exceeding 10 μg/L (Vieira et al., 2021). Lead concentrations ranged from 1.3-190 μg/L, indicating high variability and risks for children's exposure via school drinking water fountains.
    Overall, these and many other studies highlight the ubiquity of cadmium and lead contamination in drinking water globally. Ongoing research is needed to characterize exposure risks, especially focused on susceptible populations like children. This proposed study will make an important contribution by assessing current cadmium and lead levels in local drinking water sources and estimating potential health impacts.</p>

    <h2>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</h2> 
    <p>Cadmium and Lead are toxic heavy metals that can contaminate drinking water sources like rivers, lakes, and groundwater reserves. Prolonged consumption of water contaminated with even low concentrations of these metals can lead to their accumulation in the human body and cause adverse health effects like kidney, bone, and neurological disorders. Several studies have reported the presence of cadmium and lead in water bodies near industrial zones, waste dumping sites, and mining areas across various regions. However, comprehensive data on the levels of these metals in local water sources and potential health risks for communities dependent on these water resources is lacking.</p>
