    <h1>Yoruba Ethnic</h1>
    <p>Yoruba, one of the three largest ethnic groups of Nigeria, 
    concentrated in the southwestern part of that country. 
    Much smaller, scattered groups live in Benin and northern Togo. 
    The Yoruba numbered more than 20 million at the turn of the 21st century. 
    They speak a language of the Benue-Congo branch of the Niger-Congo language family.</p>

    <p>Most Yoruba men are farmers, growing yams, corn (maize), and millet as staples and plantains, 
    peanuts (groundnuts), beans, 
    and peas as subsidiary crops; cocoa is a major cash crop. 
    Others are traders or craftsmen. Women do little farm work but control much of the complex market system—their 
    status depends more on their own position in the marketplace than on their husbands’ status. 
    The Yoruba have traditionally been among the most skilled and productive craftsmen of Africa. 
    They worked at such trades as blacksmithing, weaving, leatherworking, glassmaking, and ivory and wood carving. 
    In the 13th and 14th centuries Yoruba bronze casting using the lost-wax (cire perdue) method reached a peak of 
    technical excellence never subsequently equaled in western Africa. 
    Yoruba women engage in cotton spinning, basketry, and dyeing.</p>
    <h2>Ile-Ife</h2>
    <p>Ile-Ife, town, Osun state, southwestern Nigeria. The town lies at the intersection 
    of roads from Ibadan (40 miles [64 km] west), Ilesha, and Ondo. It is one of the larger 
    centres and probably the oldest town of the Yoruba people. 
    Considered by the Yoruba to be a holy city and the legendary birthplace of humankind, 
    it was held to have been founded by a son of the deity Oduduwa and was certainly the 
    capital of a well-established kingdom (probably named for Ifa, the god of divination) by the early 11th century.</p> 
    <h2>Benin City</h2>
    <p>According to tradition, the kingdom of Benin was founded from Ife, whence, in the late 14th century, knowledge 
    of brass casting may have been introduced into Benin City for the manufacture of commemorative heads for royal 
    altars. These heads have been grouped in stylistic sequence from moderate naturalism through increasing stylization.</p>
